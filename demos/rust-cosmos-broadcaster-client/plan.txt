Plan:
* rewrite ts cosmos broadcaster SP in rust
* create simple rust binary for client cli use with 2 functions:
	* use standard CLI method - cf. NymCLI
	* getSequence() for offline signing
	* submitTx() for sending tx thru mixnet to SP for broadcasting

* rust server code - communicates with chain
	* sdk
	* nym validator client - broadcast client, gets sequence + submits tx
* rust client code - communicates with server via mixnet
	* sdk
	* nym validator client - offline signer
