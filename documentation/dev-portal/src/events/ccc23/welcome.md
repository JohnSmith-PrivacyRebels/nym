# Chaos Communication Congress 2023

At [CCC 2019](https://constructiveproof.com/posts/2020-01-27-nym-testnet-up-and-running/) we announced first demo of [Nym Mixnet](https://github.com/nymtech/nym). Now, four years later we are honored to present our new product [NymVPN](https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d), a client channeling all users internet connection through the Mixnet. At CCC 2023 we will demo run for the first time both UI application and CLI version of NymVPN.  

At first glance Nym platform may seem pretty complex. To make the connection between Nym and the community of developers, operators participating on the event as smooth as possible, we created a segment of documentation tailored for the conference. The following pages shall provide an easy gateway to Nym architecture.
