# Chaos Communication Congress 2023

At [CCC 2019](https://constructiveproof.com/posts/2020-01-27-nym-testnet-up-and-running/) we announced the first demo of the [Nym Mixnet](https://github.com/nymtech/nym). Now, four years later we are honoured to present our new product: [NymVPN](https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d). NymVPN is a client/application which captures the entire network stack of a user's device, sending this traffic through either a 2-hop VPN or through the 5-hop Mixnet. CCC 2023 is the first public demo of both the GUI and CLI versions of NymVPN.  

At first glance Nym platform may seem pretty complex. To make the connection between Nym and the community of developers, operators and users participating on the event as smooth as possible, we created a segment of documentation tailored specifically for the conference. The following pages provide an easy introduction to the NymVPN alpha client. We recommend interested developers to begin with [Nym network overview](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/network-overview.html) and the [Mixnet traffic flow](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html) pages.
