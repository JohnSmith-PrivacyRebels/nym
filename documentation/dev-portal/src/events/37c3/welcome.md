# Chaos Communication Congress 2023

At [CCC 2019](https://constructiveproof.com/posts/2020-01-27-nym-testnet-up-and-running/) we announced the first demo of [Nym Mixnet](https://github.com/nymtech/nym). Now, four years later we are honored to present our new product [NymVPN](https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d). NymVPN is a client/application channeling all users internet connection through the Mixnet. At CCC 2023 is a premiere of running a demo of both: UI application and CLI version of NymVPN.  

At first glance Nym platform may seem pretty complex. To make the connection between Nym and the community of developers, operators and users participating on the event as smooth as possible, we created a segment of documentation tailored specifically for the conference. The following pages shall provide an easy gateway to NymVPN client. If you are interested to learn more about Nym architecture, We highly recommend to begin with [Nym network overview](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/network-overview.html) and the [Mixnet traffic flow](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html).
