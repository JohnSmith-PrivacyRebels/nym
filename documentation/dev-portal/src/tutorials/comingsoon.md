# Under Construction 

Development on the Nym SDKs is currently paused - focus for the moment is on the NymVPN product and the deeper network modifications that it relies on. 

As such, the tutorials that were previously here are now both fairly out of date and underpowered. Future tutorials looking at drop in replacements for `Fetch`, using the mixnet from C/C++ and Go via FFI and a few others will be coming in the future. 

Although they have been removed, you can still find the [`developer tutorials repo`]() and the Markdown archives [here]().
