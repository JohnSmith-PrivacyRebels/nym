# Documentation

* `docs` contains technical documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/docs](https://nymtech.net/docs)
* `dev-portal` contains developer documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/developers](https://nymtech.net/developers)
* `operators` contains node setup and maintenance guides hosted at [https://nymtech.net/operators](https://nymtech.net/operators)

Each directory contains a readme with more information about running and contributing to the projects. Each is built with [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) - use `mdbook serve` to build and serve them (defaults to `localhost:3000`).
