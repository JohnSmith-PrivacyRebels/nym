Some community questions:
Hi, do you know if it's on the roadmap for network nodes (requesters, socks5 client, etc.) to reconnect to another gateway if the current gateway's connection drops or has issues? I have to reset my requester and socks5 clients to connect them to a new gateway almost every day...ðŸ˜• having to delete the entire folders associated with them

you should be able to switch gateway (and overwrite keys) using â€”force-register
