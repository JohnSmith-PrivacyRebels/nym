### Common reasons for your validator being jailed

The most common reason for your validator being jailed is that your validator is out of memory because of bloated syslogs.

Running the command `df -H` will return the size of the various partitions of your VPS.

If the `/dev/sda` partition is almost full, try pruning some of the `.gz` syslog archives and restart your validator process.
