# `mixFetch`

An easy way to secure parts or all of your web app is to replace calls to [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) with `mixFetch`:

Mixfetch works the same as vanilla `fetch` as it's a proxied wrapper around the original function:
Sounds great, are there any catches? Well, there are a few (for now):

1. Currently, the operators of Network Requesters that make the final request at the egress part of the Nym Mixnet to
the internet use a [standard allow list](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/standard-allowed-list.txt)
in combination with their own configuration. If you are trying to access something that is not on the allow list, you
have two choices:
- run your own Network Requester and locally configure it to allow the hosts you need to connect to
- get in touch with us and give us more information about the sites you want included in the standard allow list

2. We periodically update the CA certificates in `mixFetch` so if you get a certificate error, we may not have the
root CA certificate you need in our list. [Send us a PR](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pulls) if you need changes.

3. If you are using `mixFetch` in a web app with HTTPS you will need to use a gateway that has Secure Websockets to
avoid getting a [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) error.

4. Workaround for Mixed Content Errors because you might be using `mixFetch` from web app served from HTTPS while
connecting a gateway that only listens on a plain websocket, without HTTPS/TLS.

We are currently working on a feature that adds a Secure Websocket (WSS) listener with HTTPS (automatically generated with LetsEncrypt) to Nym's
gateways.

While we are adding this feature, you can use a gateway that has Caddy providing HTTPS/WSS by adding this to the options when settings up `mixFetch`:

```ts
import type { SetupMixFetchOps } from '@nymproject/mix-fetch';

const extra = {
  hiddenGateways: [
    {
      owner: 'n1kymvkx6vsq7pvn6hfurkpg06h3j4gxj4em7tlg',
      host: 'gateway1.nymtech.net',
      explicitIp: '213.219.38.119',
      identityKey: 'E3mvZTHQCdBvhfr178Swx9g4QG3kkRUun7YnToLMcMbM',
      sphinxKey: 'CYcrjoJ8GT7Dp54zViUyyRUfegeRCyPifWQZHRgMZrfX',
    },
  ],
};

const mixFetchOptions: SetupMixFetchOps = {
  preferredGateway: 'E3mvZTHQCdBvhfr178Swx9g4QG3kkRUun7YnToLMcMbM', // with WSS
  preferredNetworkRequester:
    'GiRjFWrMxt58pEMuusm4yT3RxoMD1MMPrR9M2N4VWRJP.3CNZBPq4vg7v7qozjGjdPMXcvDmkbWPCgbGCjQVw9n6Z@2xU4CBE6QiiYt6EyBXSALwxkNvM7gqJfjHXaMkjiFmYW',
  mixFetchOverride: {
    requestTimeoutMs: 60_000,
  },
  forceTls: true, // force WSS
  extra, // manually set the gateway details for WSS so certificates will work for hostname
};
```

##### Set-up your environment

Create your directory and set-up your app environment:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
Select `React` and later `Typescript` as you go to your environment set-up if you want your app to work off the bat following this tutorial. 
Then, 
```bash
cd <app_name>
npm i 
npm run dev
```

##### Installation
Install the required package:
```bash
npm install @nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat
```

##### Imports
In the `src` folder, open the `App.tsx` file and delete all the code.

Import the client in your app:
````js
import { mixFetch } from "@nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat";
````


##### Example: using the `mixFetch` client:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Again, for this example, we will be using the `full-fat` version of the ESM SDK.
</Callout>

```ts
import { mixFetch, SetupMixFetchOps } from '@nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat';
import React from 'react';

const extra = {
  hiddenGateways: [
    {
      owner: 'n1kymvkx6vsq7pvn6hfurkpg06h3j4gxj4em7tlg',
      host: 'gateway1.nymtech.net',
      explicitIp: '213.219.38.119',
      identityKey: 'E3mvZTHQCdBvhfr178Swx9g4QG3kkRUun7YnToLMcMbM',
      sphinxKey: 'CYcrjoJ8GT7Dp54zViUyyRUfegeRCyPifWQZHRgMZrfX',
    },
  ],
};

const mixFetchOptions: SetupMixFetchOps = {
  preferredGateway: 'E3mvZTHQCdBvhfr178Swx9g4QG3kkRUun7YnToLMcMbM', // with WSS
  preferredNetworkRequester:
    'GiRjFWrMxt58pEMuusm4yT3RxoMD1MMPrR9M2N4VWRJP.3CNZBPq4vg7v7qozjGjdPMXcvDmkbWPCgbGCjQVw9n6Z@2xU4CBE6QiiYt6EyBXSALwxkNvM7gqJfjHXaMkjiFmYW',
  mixFetchOverride: {
    requestTimeoutMs: 60_000,
  },
  forceTls: true, // force WSS
  extra
};


export function HttpGET() {
  const [html, setHtml] = React.useState('')
    async function get () {
      const response = await mixFetch('https://nymtech.net', { mode: 'unsafe-ignore-cors' }, mixFetchOptions)
      const text = await response.text()
      console.log('response was', text)
      setHtml(html)
    }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => { get() }}>Get</button>
    </>
  )
}

export function HttpPOST() {
    async function post () {
      const apiResponse = await mixFetch('https://postman-echo.com/post', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      }, mixFetchOptions)
      console.log(apiResponse)
    }
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => { post() }}>Post</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
    <HttpGET/>
    <HttpPOST/>
    </>
  )
}
```
