Critical bug or security issue ðŸ’¥

If you're here because you're trying to figure out how to notify us of a security issue, go to Discord, and alert the core engineers:

    Dave Hrycyszyn futurechimp#5430
    Jedrzej Stuczynski "Jedrzej | Nym#5666"
    Fran Arbanas | franarbanas#0995
    Mark Sinclair | marknym#8088 

Please avoid opening public issues on GitHub that contain information about a potential security vulnerability as this makes it difficult to reduce the impact and harm of valid security issues.
